## TODO
- [ ] Use lenses for state changes.
- [ ] Change primitive types to domain specific type aliases. E.G. `innings` in
`GameState`.
- [ ] The whole UI. I plan to do a HTMX web app.
  - [ ] Use `aeson` for marshalling data structures into JSON. For sending via a
    backend web API.
- [ ] Simulation strategy for testing.
