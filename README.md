Simulated baseball [dice game](https://milb.bamcontent.com/documents/8/5/8/313285858/BaseballDiceGame_LouisvilleBats.pdf).

## TODO

- [ ] Create an architectural diagram separating pure and impure layers.
- [ ] Do I rename the project to baseball card game? I was thinking "Waxball".
      Or something. Or do we stick with the dice theme and try to keep that involved.

### Game

- [ ] Cards

### UI

- [ ] HTMX web app.
- [ ] Card design.

### Misc

- [ ] Hot reloading.
- [ ] Use lenses for game state operations.

      backend web API.
