# Baseball Dice Game

Simulated baseball [dice game](https://milb.bamcontent.com/documents/8/5/8/313285858/BaseballDiceGame_LouisvilleBats.pdf).

## TODO

- [ ] Create an architectural diagram.
- [ ] Rename the project to baseball card game? I was thinking "Waxball".
      Or something. Or do we stick with the dice theme and try to keep that involved.

### Game

Each Game module should live in `src/Game/`.

- [ ] Card design.
